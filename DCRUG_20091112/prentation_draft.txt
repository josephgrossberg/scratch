Five steps to get a very simple Rails app up and running:
 rails dcrug
 cd dcrug
 script/generate scaffold Person first_name:string last_name:string
 rake db:migrate
 script/server

* Talk about web vs. database vs. script/console for dealing w/ models
- browser advantages: visual, what end-user sees
- browser disadvantages: indirect, limited to forms and links
- database advantages: speed, might already know SQL
- database disadvantages: no access to Ruby, vendor-specific, validations not enforced
- script/console advantages: speed, working in Ruby directly
- script/console disadvantages: you have to learn something new (which is *good* -- why we're here)
* We'll go with a combination of browser and script/console for this tutorial

ActiveRecord
* name comes from a pattern in Martin Powler's PoEAA
* ORM -- stores Ruby objects with attributes and values in a relational database with tables, columns and rows
* table -> class  /  column -> attribute  /  row -> instance and values
